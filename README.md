# Housing-Price-Analysis
This project is about Investigating factors that affect housing prices.
PROJECT 1: HOUSING PRICE ANALYSIS (EXCEL PROJECT) 
# 1. Project Overview 
This project focuses on analyzing housing price data using Microsoft Excel to uncover key 
patterns and relationships that influence property prices. The dataset contains variables such as 
price, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, furnishing status, availability of utilities, and 
other housing features. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for real estate 
stakeholders. 
# 2. Objectives 
The main objectives of this project were to:  
• Calculate summary statistics such as average, minimum, and maximum values for key 
variables (price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.).  
• Segment housing prices into categories (Low, Medium, and High).  
• Examine how housing features (e.g., furnishing status, AC, basement, parking) relate to 
price categories.  
• Develop a clean and interactive Excel dashboard to visualize insights. 
# 3. Methodology 
3.1 Data Cleaning 
• Removed empty and duplicate rows. 
• Ensured all numerical columns (price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms) were correctly 
formatted as numbers. 
• Standardized categorical variables such as furnishing status and utility indicators. 
3.2 Data Analysis 
• Used Excel functions such as AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNTIF, and IF to compute 
descriptive statistics. 
• Categorized housing prices into Low, Medium, and High using conditional logic. 
• Built pivot tables to summarize housing features across price categories. 
3.3 Dashboard Creation 
• Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot charts and slicers. 
• Added filters for bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other features to allow dynamic 
exploration of the data.

# 4. Key Findings 
• The average house price was 4,767,740.19 
• The minimum and maximum house prices were 1,750,000.00 and 13,300,000.00 
respectively. 
• Most houses fell within the Low-price category. 
• Properties in the Medium and High price categories showed a higher likelihood of having 
features such as AC, furnishing, and basements. 
• Larger houses generally correspond with higher prices. 
# 5. Visuals / Dashboard Summary 
The Excel dashboard includes: - Summary cards showing average, minimum, and maximum 
values. - Bar charts comparing housing features across price categories. - Interactive slicers for 
filtering by bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other attributes.

# 6. Conclusion & Recommendations 
The analysis reveals a strong concentration of properties in the low-price segment, suggesting 
affordability trends within the dataset. However, houses with additional features such as AC, 
furnishing, and basements tend to command higher prices. 
Recommendations: - Real estate developers can improve property value by targeting feature 
upgrades common in the medium-price segment. - Property listings should emphasize value
adding features such as AC and basement availability. - Future analysis could incorporate 
location data to provide deeper market insights.
